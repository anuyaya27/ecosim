**Ecosim** is an interactive policy simulation tool designed to help users understand the economic effects of changes in government policies. It models the impact of reforms like Universal Basic Income (UBI), progressive tax structures, and minimum wage adjustments on various income groups using real-world data and principles from behavioral economics.

## Project Overview

This tool provides a way to explore how policy changes influence:

- Distribution of income across households
- Government revenue generation
- Measures of economic inequality
- Overall household welfare

Ecosim can be useful for researchers, students, and policymakers who want to test the consequences of specific policy choices in a structured and data-driven environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`
- **Streamlit** for the interactive interface
- **Publicly available datasets**
  - IPUMS USA, Census PUMS, and others

## Key Features

- Interactive visualizations showing the effects of policy changes
- Simulations for:
  - Universal Basic Income (UBI)
  - Tax bracket and rate modifications
  - Minimum wage increases
- Support for user-defined datasets
- Filtering options for demographic variables like age, income, and household composition
- Graphs and statistics to help interpret inequality and welfare outcomes
